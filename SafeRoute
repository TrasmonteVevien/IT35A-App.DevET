"SafeRoute: Travel Safety Monitoring App"

Goals: 
SafeRoute improves travel safety, reduces crime risks, and enhances emergency response, aligning with SDG 3 (Health & Well-Being), SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities), and SDG 16 (Peace & Justice).It also promotes open-source innovation for safer urban mobility.

Role:
As a mobile/web developer.

Audience:
Students commuting in the night.
Workers on late shifts.
Commuters using public/private transport.
Emergency responders for faster action.


Situation:
Many cities face unsafe nighttime travel, transport-related crimes, and slow emergency response.
SafeRoute addresses these problems with real-time tracking, transport verification, and AI-driven risk alerts, making urban travel safer.


Objectives:
SafeRoute ensures the safety of students, workers, and commuters traveling at night. 
It uses GPS, AI-powered risk detection, and geofencing to monitor travel routes, verify transport details, and send emergency alerts. 
The app contributes to the UN SDGs by enhancing urban mobility, reducing crime risks, and improving emergency responses.


Key SDGs Targeted:
A. SDG 3: Good Health and Well-Being – Ensures safety during travel.
B. SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities – Improves public transport safety.
C. SDG 16: Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions – Prevents crimes through real-time alerts.


Key Features:  
1.Real-Time Location Tracking – Share location with trusted contacts.
2.Transport Verification – Verifies vehicle details before boarding.
3.Geofencing Alerts – Notifies users when leaving or entering safe zones.
4.Emergency SOS – Alerts emergency contacts and authorities.
5.AI Risk Detection – Analyzes routes for safer travel suggestions.


Technical Architecture:
Fronten: iOS/Android app (React Native/Flutter).  
Backend: Cloud-based (AWS/Google Cloud) for real-time data processing.  
AI & GPS: AI analyzes risks and geofencing technology provides alerts.  
Alerts & Notifications: If a risk is detected, notifications are sent to users, trusted contacts, or emergency responders.
Geofencing triggers safe zone entry/exit alerts.
